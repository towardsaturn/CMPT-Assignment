<i>This also works as a disclaimer</i><br /><br />
Mp3 Jam has a long rich history. The webpage was established sometime in June by the lovely, Crystal Ma for an assignment required in her CMPT165 class at <a href="http://sfu.ca" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a>.
No this page does not actually sell mp3's. If you somehow came here in search of mp3's, please let me redirect you to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/itunes/" target="_blank">Itunes</a>.  Good luck on your quest for music.
